oh sure, please share
ssv [4:24 PM]
may be we will need free sign up - but
I thought we can get the course structure and stuff assets using OER content ( may be solr search )
For example:

you can see weeks - having course materials
ex:
BRANDING: Marketing Strategy and Brand Positioning
Shivaprasad Kyathanatty [4:27 PM]
correct
looks good
ssv [4:28 PM]

Shivaprasad Kyathanatty [4:28 PM]
let me share with neha
and see what she thinks
will create a ticket
and track
looks good
ssv [4:33 PM]
Once we have the course structure - we can search in SOLR - and get the related assets per chapter / week
ex:
http://10.54.199.117:8983/solr/emr-20190420/select?q=GO%20TO%20MARKET%20STRATEGIES%20Online-Offline%20Interaction%20&%20How%20to%20Find%20Lead%20Users%20and%20Facilitate%20Influence%20and%20Contagion%20Introduction%20and%20Execution

pending for Neha:
https://acelearningco.atlassian.net/browse/CO-623
 there are some textbooks with less than 5 assets and Shivaprasad Kyathanatty asked me to create google sheet with details of these books. Should we create courses for these?

https://acelearningco.atlassian.net/browse/CO-602
above 57 databases from proquest are not crawled till date out of which 22 have got data from year 2010.  Should any of these databases be prioritized for crawling? Note: these are subscribed by either of these institutes (APUS/TROY/KENNESAW).
